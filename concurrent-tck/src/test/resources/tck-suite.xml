            HOWTO from Scott Marlow:
            FYI, if anyone on this mailing list wants to see some examples of existing TCK challenges,
            https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-tck/projects/2 has a few listed.  Basically the person
            challenging the test would create an issue with label `challenge` in
            https://github.com/jakartaee/concurrency/issue to initiate it.  More guidance is in
            https://jakarta.ee/committees/specification/tckprocess.

                    <!-- From Nathan Rauh:
                        It looks like a mistake in the test case where it is accidentally testing the ‘unchanged’
                        setting as though it were ‘cleared’.  The `unchanged` setting leaves the context type alone, so
                        whatever the context was on the thread before it must remain.  The mistake went unnoticed on
                        Open Liberty because the state of the thread happens to already match the test assertion. 
                        This one should definitely be challenged for the mistaken assertion.
